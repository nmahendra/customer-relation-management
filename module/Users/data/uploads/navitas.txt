Dear sir/madam

I found the Junior Linux Adminstrator position throug Alba Rectruetment Agency,
and I am very excited about this job. However, unfortunetly, Navitas has inform
Richard I am not suitable because I have more experience.

The majority of my experience is in PHP development with Linux Administration
and I have nearly 3 years working expereince in Linux Administration tasks.

On a matter of personal note, I have a keen passion for Linux and open source
products. However, find a Linux job with my experience is very difficult in
Perth, and also post very less Linux jobs.

If Navitas allow me, I am willing to work for your company as Intern without
asking any salary or package. I need to stay touch with really Linux environment
and get more qualification as System Administrator.

I hope you will consider my honest and humble request.

Thanks best regards,
Mahendra
